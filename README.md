# yet-another-password

## Description

- To generate a password for users who use interfaces that require them to change their passwords frequently.


## Installation

Started with putting all the things needed in variables.
I then generated the multiple prompts.
After the first prompt i knew to write an "if" statement afterwards stating that the characters in the password needed to be greater than 8 and shorter than 125, if they didnt pick otherwise.
I then followed up with asking the user if they wanted uppercase and/or lowercase letters included, then special characters.
Once the user picks from the prompts, the site then randomly generates a password, including all their choices.


## Usage

-Start by clicking the "Generate Password" button on the screen.
-Go through the series of prompts and answer each one to your liking.
-Once finished a password is automatically generated.
